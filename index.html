		<p> Hi, I'm John Kim. I am a freshman in highschool and I am looking into the science field as for what I want to do. Specifically, the computer science field, whice should be fairly obvious from the fact that I made this site from scratch. I have lived in a variety of countries and cultures. First, I am Korean and I have Korean parents. I was born in the USA, Delaware to be exact. We moved to Rome, Italy when I was about three. Just when I was about to go into elementary school, we moved again to Saudi Arabia and stayed there until 5th grade. Living there was truly an interesting experience, the culture at the time definitley contributed. In Saudi I first found my affection for the computer sciences. I joined coding club and started on my journey. After that, right before my 6th grade year, we moved to Montana, where I still am. Here, I have greatly increased my coding skills and expanded my capabilities to where it is today.</p>
		<h2>Languages (Coding):</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>JavaScript</li>
			<li>HTML & CSS</li>
			<li>Basic Database Management in SQLite</li>
			<li>Python 2.7 & 3</li>
			<li>Game Development in C# (Unity)</li>
			<li>Robotics in C & C++</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Experiences:</h2>
		<p>Through all my life, I have had experience with many different coding languages. I was introduced to coding by scratch, like many people have. I worked with C and C++ while doing my Vex Robotics career, then, I learned Javascript, HTML, and CSS over the 8th grade summer. Pretty cool huh?</p>
