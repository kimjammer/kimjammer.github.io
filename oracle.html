		<p class="large">Hello Oracle!</p>
		<p>I am John Kim, a freshman at Bozeman High School. I love coding and the computer sciences and want to go towards that field. Through my english teacher and Oracle's large presence in the computer world, I have heard about the many things that you do. So, I though this. I need some experience to get into jobs in the computer field, and jobs require experience. An endless loop that prohibits and limits the highschooler's ability to learn and get experience. I request this. Could I come to your office during the summer and learn about how you work?</p>
		<p>I don't want much, just the chance to come for a week or two learning about how a team works, how they keep their workflow straight. Even if it's making you guys coffee in the morning and doing random chores, I would be glad to help.</p>
		<p>Feel Free to look around my website that I wrote and please consider this! Thanks.</p>
